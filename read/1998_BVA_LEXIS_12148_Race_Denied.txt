THE ISSUE
Entitlement  to service connection for post-traumatic   stress   disorder. 
INTRODUCTION
The veteran  had active service from August 1966 to April 1969.
CONTENTIONS OF APPELLANT ON APPEAL
The veteran  contends that he currently has post-traumatic   stress   disorder  which is attributable to service. He maintains that he was subjected to intense racism  during service; that he was unable to shake his feelings  of worthlessness ingrained into him while in service; and that he was hit with rockets and small arms fire, and was exposed to the smell of death during his tour of duty in Vietnam.
DECISION OF THE BOARD
In accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A.  7104 [West 1991 & Supp. 1997], the Board of Veterans  Appeals [Board] has reviewed and considered all of the evidence and material of record in the veteran's  claims file. Based on a review of the relevant evidence in this matter, and for the following reasons and bases, it is the decision of the Board that the claim for service connection for post-traumatic   stress   disorder  is not well grounded. 
FINDING OF FACT
The claim of entitlement  to service connection for post- traumatic   stress   disorder  is not plausible or capable of substantiation because post-traumatic   stress   disorder  has not been clearly diagnosed.
CONCLUSION OF LAW
The claim of entitlement  to service connection for post- traumatic   stress   disorder  is not well grounded.   38 U.S.C.A.  5107[a] [West 1991]; 38 C.F.R.  3.304 [f].
REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION
Background
The service records reveal that the veterans  awards and decorations include the Vietnam Service Medal and Vietnam Campaign Medal, and that his military occupational specialty was that of a parts storekeeper.
The service medical records disclose  no complaints or findings referable to psychiatric  symptoms, or diagnosis  of or treatment for a psychiatric   disability.  Separation examination in April 1969 revealed no psychiatric  abnormality.
In a statement dated in April 1994, the veterans  parents wrote that the veteran  became a different person in service; that since service he had experienced alcohol  problems, drug abuse, and domestic violence during his marriage; and that he had been unable to hold a job and had lost over 30 jobs. They further related that he was incapable of maintaining friendship; that all of his relationship had ended with bitterness, hate, and often violence; that he trusted no one; and that he gave a history of racism  in service.
Included as part of the record are copies of Department of Veterans  Affairs [VA] medical and clinical  reports, showing treatment of the veteran  for various disorder  in 1993. In a medical certificate, dated July 26, 1993, it was reported that the veteran  complained of sleeping trouble, nightmares, suicidal thoughts, and angry and guilty feelings;  and that the diagnostic impressions  included post-traumatic   stress   disorder.  He was admitted to a VA hospital that day. A clinical  record, dated in August 1993, discloses  that the veteran  was in Vietnam in a noncombat position. In a progress note of August 1993, it was mentioned that the diagnosis  of the veterans   psychiatric  condition was ruleout borderline narcissistic   personality disorder.  A VA hospital summary of early September 1993 discloses  a diagnosis  of alcohol  dependence, polysubstance abuse; and personality disorder,  mixed narcissistic  and antisocial. Another hospital summary of late September 1993 shows a diagnosis  of possible post-traumatic   stress   disorder;  the summary reveals no evidence of a stressor in service which could have led to post-traumatic   stress   disorder. 
Analysis
It should be noted that the Board must first determine whether a claim is well grounded  within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A.  5107[a] [West 1991]. That is, the claim must be plausible before the Board will consider the claim on the merits. The threshold question which must be resolved with regard to a claim is whether the veteran  has presented evidence that the claim is well grounded.  See 38 U.S.C.A.  5107[a] [West 1991]; Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78 [1990]. A well-grounded  claim is a plausible claim, meaning a claim which appears to be meritorious. See Murphy, 1 Vet. App. at 81. An allegation that a disorder  is service connected is not sufficient; the veteran  must submit evidence  in support of the claim that would justify a belief by a fair and impartial individual that the claim is plausible. See 38 U.S.C.A.  5107[a]; Tirpak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 609, 611 [1992]. The quality and quantity of the evidence required to meet the statutory burden of necessity will depend upon the issue presented by the claim. Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91 [1993].
In order for a service connection claim to be well grounded,  there must be competent evidence  that the veteran  currently has the disability.  See Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 [1992]. There must also be evidence of incurrence or aggravation for a disease  or injury in service. See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 [1995], affd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 [Fed.Cir.1996]. The veteran  must also submit evidence  of a nexus between the inservice disease  or injury and the current disability.  Id. If the determinative issue is one of medical etiology  or a medical diagnosis,  competent medical evidence  must be submitted to make the claim well grounded.  See Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 93. A lay person  is not competent to make a medical diagnosis  or to relate a medical disorder  to a specific cause. See Espiritu v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 492, 494 [1992]. If the veteran  fails to submit evidence  in support of a plausible claim, the VA is under no duty to assist the veteran  in any further development of the claim.
The Board notes that the United States Court of Veterans  Appeals [Court] has held that there is some duty to assist a veteran  in the completion of his application for benefits under 38 U.S.C.A.  5103[a], depending on the particular facts in each case. Beausoleil v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 459 [1996]; Robinette v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 69 [1995].
To establish service connection for a disability,  the evidence must show that the disability  began in service, or if preexisting service, that it was aggravated therein. 38 U.S.C.A.  1110. With respect to PTSD, there must be a clear diagnosis  of that disorder.  38 C.F.R.  3.304 [f].
A careful review of the veterans  service medical records, including the separation examination report of April 1969, discloses  no evidence of post-traumatic   stress   disorder.  In fact, the postservice psychiatric  examinations fail to reveal a clear diagnosis  of post-traumatic   stress   disorder.  Although the veteran  argues that he has post-traumatic   stress   disorder,  and that it was related to service, he is a lay person  who has no medical education, training or experience to render an expert opinion as to the nature, etiology,  and date of onset of a disease  entity. In this connection, it is important to emphasize that the impression  of PTSD which led to his hospitalization in the summer of 1993 was not confirmed after his lengthy stay.
To establish a well-grounded  claim, there must be competent evidence  showing that the claimed disability  was related to service. Such showing was not demonstrated for the veterans   post-traumatic   stress   disorder.  While the veteran  asserted otherwise, he is not an expert who can competently render a medical opinion. The veteran  has the burden of demonstrating by competent medical evidence  that he currently has post- traumatic   stress   disorder.  In the absence of competent medical evidence  establishing the presence of post-traumatic   stress   disorder,  the Board holds that the claim for service connection for post-traumatic   stress   disorder  is not well grounded  and must be denied.
ORDER
The claim of entitlement  to service connection for post- traumatic   stress   disorder  is denied.
